# Deploying a Custom Deep Learning Tensorflow Model using Tensorflow Serving with Docker and Flask

This boilerplate was based on this [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-deep-learning-models-using-tensorflow-serving-with-docker-and-flask-3b9a76ffbbda) and the image classification model was created based on this [tutorial](https://androidkt.com/tensorflow-model-for-prediction-from-scratch/).

## Environment Setup (Linux)

1. Set up a virtual environment using Python 3.7.0 and install the required dependencies by running:

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
